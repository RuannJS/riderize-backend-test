## Project Background


This project was developed as a part of a old job interview process for Riderize. The goal was to create a backend API for the Riderize platform, showcasing my skills in application development, database management, and API design.

- **Nest.js:** Project was built using Nest.js, a powerful and extensible Node.js framework written in TypeScript. It provides a structured and efficient way to develop APIs.

- **Prisma:** An innovative database toolkit, for seamless database operations. It makes working with databases a breeze.

- **MongoDB Atlas:** Riderize's data is securely stored in MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-based MongoDB database service. This ensures data reliability and scalability.
